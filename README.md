Could you write me a todo list management web application where:
 * I can have my todo list displayed.
 * I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).
 * Assign priorities and due dates to the entries.
 * I can sort my entry lists using due date and priority.
 * I can mark an entry as completed.
 * Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
 * I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
 not an option.
 * Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).
